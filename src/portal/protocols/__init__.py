"""
Protocols Package
=================

Protocol-level integrations that are first-class citizens
in the Portal architecture.

Modules:
--------
- mcp: Model Context Protocol (bidirectional client/server)

Unlike tools (which are user-facing features), protocols are
infrastructure-level integrations that enable core functionality.
